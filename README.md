# Speeddating Timer

## Use the timer [here](https://mdsnouck.github.io/speeddating-timer).

I need to mention that I used the Grayscale template by [_David Miller_](https://github.com/davidtmiller), Managing Parter at [Iron Summit Media Strategies](http://www.ironsummitmedia.com/) for this app.

You are not allowed to use the heart shaped logos or "Speeddate" lettering without my permission.

Have fun.<br>
